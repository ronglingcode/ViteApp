VWAP Continuation

Summary:
Look for price trending in the direction of VWAP, with pullbacks holding above VWAP (for long) or below VWAP (for short). Enter on the continuation after a clear pullback, with confirmation from volume or price structure.

Entry:
- Enter long when price pulls back towards VWAP and resumes upward movement, with higher lows and volume holding.
- Enter short when price pulls back towards VWAP from below, and resumes downward move after lower high.

Stop Loss:
- Place stop just below VWAP (for long) or just above (for short).
- Alternatively, use recent swing low/high.

Targets:
- Next intraday resistance (for long) or support (for short)
- Scalp partial at fixed risk/reward (e.g. 2R), trail remainder.

Invalidation:
- Price closes convincingly through VWAP in the opposite direction.
- Heavy volume reversal candle.

Considerations:
- Avoid entry late in the trend or after a large extension.
- Watch for high volume climactic moves away from VWAP.
- Ideal in clean, liquid stocks with extended intraday moves.

Notes:
- VWAP acts as dynamic support/resistance.
- Volume confirmation increases probability.
