Long VWAP Continuation

Intraday Setup:
Open price is above vwap and vwap is above inflection level.

Summary:
We look for breakouts to go long when it occurs above both vwap and inflection level.

Entry:
- Enter long when price pulls back towards VWAP and resumes upward movement, with higher lows and volume holding.
- Enter short when price pulls back towards VWAP from below, and resumes downward move after lower high.

Stop Loss:
- Place stop just below VWAP (for long) or just above (for short).
- Alternatively, use recent swing low/high.

Targets:
- Next intraday resistance (for long) or support (for short)
- Scalp partial at fixed risk/reward (e.g. 2R), trail remainder.

Invalidation:
- Price closes convincingly through VWAP in the opposite direction.
- Heavy volume reversal candle.

Considerations:
- Avoid entry late in the trend or after a large extension.
- Watch for high volume climactic moves away from VWAP.
- Ideal in clean, liquid stocks with extended intraday moves.

Notes:
- VWAP acts as dynamic support/resistance.
- Volume confirmation increases probability.
